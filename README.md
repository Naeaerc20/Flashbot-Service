Flashbot Rescue Service

Hello all guys! I opened this repository to write details about this new project I'm starting.

As you know, day after day many people tend to get hacked and end up with their wallets being hacked by thieves from the blockchain world, because of; sign a permit, connect wallets to phishing, or give their private keys to inappropriate people (Always keep your keys Private!!)

I open this repository to let you know that if you know someone or if you have a compromised wallet that needs a rescue of funds still existing in the wallet, you can apply here "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/ 19PvQfcmoBm6fFsFKSVdaNhAjZFl_p5nIZsIr0K89QuY"

I can perform rescues on any EVM network at the moment without a 100% success guarantee however with a high probability of success rate (the chains where my support does not apply are; solana and any cosmos chain).

Note: I am not linked to the Flashbots company nor do I work for them, however their technology is open source, but it only works on Ethereum Mainnet, for other chains special techniques will be required.

In addition to this, I will publish the successful rescue cases on this Telegram channel: "https://t.me/naeaexeth_rescues" as a Proof of Work.

This will be a job very separate from the development projects that I constantly carry out.
